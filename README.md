Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Description:
This project is about a simple web page using some of the
topics learned on the two first lectures of the course.
The content I have decided to add within my page is like
a personal repository about the AWS platform. I am doing some
studies on the field and would like to feed my page with
new notes and experiences as I get on hands with it.

As of now, I have created 4 html pages:

index.html: is the main page based on pure HTML and linked to
a style sheet file.

AWS_S3.html, AWS_EBS.html and AWS_Glacier.html: are all pages
created using bootstrap and have their style embedded.

The original style sheet for the main page was the "style.css" file
and then I changed it to "styleSass.scss" to include some Sass features.

There is an images folder where I put the images I use on the page.

I also enabled the GitHub pages to make the web page available as
a public site to check the content on my cellphone and test the
responsive behavior of the pages. I defined the screen limits size based
on my cellphone resolution characteristics, so it may not look good
in some devices. (Need to work on that too.).

I think I still need to work on the page and in the future
I would like to be it more dynamic and maybe include additional
features to have it more rich.

I hope it is good for now and I appreciate your feedback
and recommendations, thanks!
