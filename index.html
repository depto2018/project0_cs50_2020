                                <p>Hi all, my name is Diego, I am 30 years old and I studied electronics but most of my experience has been on networking and rigth now,
                                I am a remote applications support engineer for a company called NICE. I am colombian and as most of people here, I love playing soccer and cycling as well. This is my
                                first web page, I do not have any experience on web development but I am motivated to start digging into this field as I found it to be very interesting
                                and would like to have a better understanding of how the front and backend integrates and the code in between. I want to use this first project to share
                                some notes about AWS (Amazon Web Services) as I am following some courses about it as well. I am just taking advantage of my time at home while
                                the pandemic hopefully is over. All the text I will put here is based on my personal understanding and opinion. On the right you will see a picture with my mom
                                the other day we went for a hicking close to our city.</p>

                <h3>What is AWS?</h3>

                <p>
                  AWS or Amazon Web Services is a cloud computing platform which provides a bunch of computational resources on the cloud offering a pay as you go
                  model meaning that you pay only for the resources you use on a certain period of time. The benefits of using the power of a cloud computing solution
                  like this one is the ability to have your infrastructure deployed a lot faster than the time you will take to deploy an on-premise solution where
                  you need to start from racking your devices on a datacenter, cabling, and considering all the physical security needs you need to take into
                  account for this. Apart from that, you will also need to take care of the OS installation and applications deployment which will also require big
                  efforts. Cloud computing eases the deployment of all resources for you.
                </p>

                      Big competitors of AWS nowadays are Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. However, AWS is the actual lead on the market.

                <h3>AWS infrastructure</h3>

                <p>
                  The AWS infrastructure is composed by Regions which are physical geographic locations around the world where datacenters are deployed. Within the
                  regions we find Avaliability Zones (AZ) which are groups of interconnected datacenters. Likewise, AZs within a region are connected through high
                  speed lines for Avaliability and Reliability porpuses. There are also other infrastructure concepts like AWS Local Zones, AWS wavelength and AWS
                  Outsposts which are meant to provide very low latency scenarios for development and testing purposes. Additional information about AWS infrastructure
                  can be found on the following link, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/?p=ngi&loc=2">AWS infrastructure</a>.
                </p>

                <p>A summary of the actual status of the AWS infrastructure is shown in the following table.</p>

                <table>
                  <tr>
                    <th>Component</th>

                    <h3>How do you decide which Region to choose?</h3>

                    <p>Important factors you need to take into account for choosing the correct region are the following:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Latency:</strong> Closer to end users.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Every region may have different costs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Legal restrictions according to location policies.</li>
                        <li><strong>Service availability:</strong> New services may run on specific regions only.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
