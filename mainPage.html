          <h1>Amazon Web Services (AWS) - Notes</h1>

          <h3>Something about myself...</h3>

          <p>
            Well, my name is Diego, I am 30 years old and I have a bachelor's degree in electronics but most of my experience has been on networking and rigth now,
            I am an applications support engineer for NICE ltda. I am colombian and as most of people here, I love playing soccer and cycling as well. This is my
            first web page, I do not have any experience on web development but I am motivated to start digging into this field as I found it to be very interesting
            and would like to have a better understanding of how the front and backend integrates and the code in between. I want to use this first project to share
            some notes about AWS (Amazon Web Services) as I am following some courses about it as well. I am just taking advantage of my time at home while
            the pandemic hopefully is over. All the text I will put here is based on my personal understanding and opinion.

          <h3>What is AWS?</h3>

          <p>
            AWS or Amazon Web Services is a cloud computing platform which provides a bunch of computational resources on the cloud offering a pay as you go
            model meaning that you pay only for the resources you use on a certain period of time. The benefits of using the power of a cloud computing solution
            like this one is the ability to have your infrastructure deployed a lot faster than the time you will take to deploy an on-premise solution where
            you need to start from racking your devices on a datacenter, cabling, and considering all the physical security needs you need to take into
            account for this. Apart from that, you will also need to take care of the OS installation and applications deployment which will also require big
            efforts. Cloud computing eases the deployment of all resources for you.
          </p>

          <p>  
            Big competitors of AWS nowadays are Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. However, AWS is the actual lead on the market.
