                <h1>AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)</h1>

                <h2>What is AWS S3?</h2>

                <p>AWS S3 is an object (file) level storage service which can be used to save general purpose data on the cloud and access it from anywhere.
                It can be seen as a NAS (Network Attached Storage) in an on-premise network. General features of AWS S3 are the following:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Data is distributed across at least three AZs with the exception of 1A class S3 services where the data is kept in one AZ only, which
                    makes it a cheaper solution.</li>
                    <li>It supports encryption.</li>
                    <li>Provides automatic data classification. For example if data is not manipulated in any way during a certain period of time, it can be
                    automatically moved to AWS Glacier for long term storage.</li>
                    <li>Useful for big data analytics.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Some AWS S3 concepts...</h2>

                <h3>Objects</h3>

                <p>AWS names files as objects. Each object is identified through an URL (Uniform Resource Locator) from which the object can be accessed.
                  The following graph shows the structure of an object URL.</p

            </div>

            <div class="container-fluid">

                <p>Objects in S3 have eventual consistency, which means that anytime an object is modified it will get replicated in all AZs but it might
                  take some time as a difference with AWS EBS where objects are consistent.</p>

                <h3>Buckets</h3>

                <p>Buckets are basically containers to store the objects.</p>

                <h3>REST</h3>

                <p>S3 is based on REST (Representational State Transfer) which is a system interface that maps HTTP methods to CRUD operations:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>C</strong>reate &#8594; Put or Post operation.</li>
                    <li><strong>R</strong>ead &#8594; Get operation.</li>
                    <li><strong>U</strong>pdate &#8594; Post or Put operation.</li>
                    <li><strong>D</strong>elete &#8594; Delete operation.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong> It is more common to use Put operation for create actions and Post for updates, but they can interchanged.</p>

                <h2>How to put data into S3?</h2>

                <p>There are different ways of getting data into S3 as follows:<p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Uploading the files manually to an S3 bucket from your local desktop like the way you do with a storage cloud service like google drive
                    or dropbox.</li>
                    <li>Files can be uploaded through an API (Application Programming Interface).</li>
                    <li>Amazon Direct Connect can be used to upload files through a VPN.</li>
                    <li>An Storage Gateway can also be used to synchronize local data into AWS S3.</li>
                    <li>Through Kinesis Firehose?</li>
                    <li>Transfer acceleration and optimized data access can be done through AWS cloud front.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>S3 storage classes</h2>

                <p>There are different types of storage classes which will offer more or less benefits but with a cost effect. Main classes are the following:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Standard:</strong> This is the most expensive.</li>
                    <li><strong>Infrequent access storage (IA):</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Reduced redundancy storage (RRS):</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Glacier:</strong> This is the less expensive one.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Data can be moved from standard to either IA or Glacier based on time policies known as Object Lifecycle Management.</p>

                <h2>Some S3 facts...</h2>

                <ul class="list-group">
                    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-success">Bucket names must be globally unique.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary">Objects versioning can be suspended but not Disabled.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-info">Objects inherit permissions from the bucket's but they can be overwritten at the object level.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-warning">Tags are used to search, organize and manage object access. An object can have up to 10 tags.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-primary">When you delete an object, it is only marked for deletion at first time so you can recover it. They get completed deleted after...</li>
                </ul>
