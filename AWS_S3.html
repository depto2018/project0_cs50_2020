                    <h2 class="text-danger">What is AWS S3?</h2>

                    <p>AWS S3 is an object (file) level storage service which can be used to save general purpose data on the cloud and access it from anywhere.
                    It can be seen as a NAS (Network Attached Storage) in an on-premise network. General features of AWS S3 are the following:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Data is distributed across at least three AZs with the exception of One Zone-IA class S3 storage where the data is kept in one AZ only, which
                        makes it a cheaper solution.</li>
                        <li>It supports encryption.</li>
                        <li>Provides automatic data classification. For example if data is not manipulated in any way during a certain period of time, it can be
                        automatically moved to AWS Glacier for long term storage.</li>
                        <li>Useful for big data analytics.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="text-danger">Some AWS S3 concepts...</h2>

                    <h4 class="text-primary">Objects</h4>

                    <p>AWS names files as objects. Each object is identified through an URL (Uniform Resource Locator) from which the object can be accessed.
                      The following graph shows the structure of an object URL.</p>

                </div>

                <div class="container">
                      <div class="col-12 mx-auto text-center" style="margin-bottom:20px">
                            <img src="./images/ObjectAWS_S3.png" class="img-fluid">
                      </div>
                </div>

                <div class="container">

                    <p>Objects in S3 have eventual consistency, which means that anytime an object is modified it will get replicated in all AZs but it might
                      take some time as a difference with AWS EBS where objects are consistent.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-primary">Buckets</h4>

                    <p>Buckets are basically containers to store the objects.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-primary">REST</h4>

                    <p>S3 is based on REST (Representational State Transfer) which is a system interface that maps HTTP methods to CRUD operations:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>C</strong>reate &#8594; Put or Post operation.</li>
                        <li><strong>R</strong>ead &#8594; Get operation.</li>
                        <li><strong>U</strong>pdate &#8594; Post or Put operation.</li>
                        <li><strong>D</strong>elete &#8594; Delete operation.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> It is more common to use Put operations for create actions and Post for update actions, but they can be interchanged.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-danger">How to put data into S3?</h2>

                    <p>There are different ways of getting data into S3 as follows:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Uploading the files manually to an S3 bucket from your local desktop like the way you do with a storage cloud service like google drive
                        or dropbox.</li>
                        <li>Files can be uploaded through an API (Application Programming Interface).</li>
                        <li>Amazon Direct Connect can be used to upload files through a VPN.</li>
                        <li>An Storage Gateway can also be used to synchronize local data into AWS S3.</li>
                        <li>Through Kinesis Firehose?</li>
                        <li>Transfer acceleration and optimized data access can be done through AWS cloud front.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="text-danger">S3 storage classes</h2>

                    <p>There are different types of storage classes which will offer you more or less benefits with different cost chargings. Storage classes can be
                      categorized as follows:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>General Purpose</strong></li>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Standard:</strong> This is to store fequently accessed data with low latency and high throughput performance. Ideal for
                                web applications, gaming, big data, etc.</li>
                                <li><strong>Intelligent-tiering:</strong> This is for unkonwn or changing access. It automatically moves objects between two access tiers
                                (Frequent and Infrequent tiers) based on changing access patterns.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li><strong>Infrequent access (IA)</strong></li>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Standard IA:</strong> This is for data that is accessed less frequently, but require rapid access if needed. Ideal solution
                                for backups and disaster recovery data.</li>
                                <li><strong>One Zone-IA:</strong> This class provides same features as standard-IA, but data is stored in one AZ only. In any of the
                                other cases data is stored on a minimum of 3 AZs. Ideal for secondary backups or easily re-creatable data.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li><strong>Archive</strong></li>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Glacier:</strong> Low cost class for data archiving. It provides different retrieval options ranging from minutes to hours
                                based on customer needs.</li>
                                <li><strong>Glacier deep archive:</strong> Lowest cost storage class. It is designed for long-term retention data that will be
                                retained for 7-10 years. Data can be retrieved within 12 hours.</li>
                            </ul>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Data can be moved from standard to either IA or Glacier based on time policies known as S3 Object Lifecycle Management. For further detailed
                    information, you can go to the AWS website: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/?nc=sn&loc=3"><u>AWS S3.</u></a> </p>

                    <ul class="list-unstyled">
                        <li>&rArr;	A single object can be up to 5 TB in size.</li>
                        <li>&rArr;	Bucket names must be globally unique.</li>
                        <li>&rArr;	S3 classes can be configured at the object level and a single bucket may have objects stored using different classes.</li>
                        <li>&rArr;	Objects versioning can be suspended but not Disabled.</li>
                        <li>&rArr;	Objects inherit permissions from the bucket's but they can be overwritten at the object level.</li>
                        <li>&rArr;	Tags are used to search, organize and manage object access. An object can have up to 10 tags.</li>
                        <li>&rArr;	When you delete an object, it is only marked for deletion at first time so you can recover it later.</li>
                   </ul>
