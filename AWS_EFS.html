            </div>

            <div class="container">
                  <p class="text-justify">AWS EBS or Elastic Block Store is a block level storage for AWS services. Block storage allows for the creation of raw storage volumes which servers
                    based operative system can connect to, a kind of hard drive. One important difference between object storage and block storage, is that the former can
                    handle additional metadata like detailed information about the data files stored in the object. For example, in a video file you can include information
                    about wheret he video was made, the type of camera used and subjects captured in each frame. Whereas in block storage metadata is limited to basic
                    file attributes. That is why EBS volumes are used for persistent, durable and customizable block storage for EC2 instances. On the other hand, object
                    level storage is used by AWS S3.</p>

                  <p class="text-justify">EBS volumes are replicated within an AZ and can easily scale up to petabytes of data. AWS EBS provides the following two
                    main volume types:</p>

                <p class="font-italic">IOPS: Input/output Operations per Second</p>
                <p class="font-italic">General Purpose SSD (gp2) is the default volume for EC2 instances.</p>
                <p class="font-italic">To maximize the performance of any EBS volume, AWS recommends to use EBS-Optimized EC2 instances.</p>

                <h2 class="text-danger">Some AWS EBS facts...</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>The Amazon data lifecycle manager can be used to automate the process of taking EBS snapshots according to user defined policies.</li>
                    <li>EBS volumes are elastic which means, anytime the user may increase capacity, tune performance and change the type of any volume with
                    no downtime or impact.</li>
                    <li>EBS volumes and snpashots can be encrypted with general or user created keys.</li>
                    <li>Amazon EBS Multi-Attach allows an EBS io1 volume to be attached concurrently to up to 16 Nitro-based EC2 insatnces within the same AZ.</li>
                    <li>EC2 instances and EBS volumes need to be on the same AZ.</li>
               </ul>

               <p>AWS provides a bunch of features in regards to the way snapshots can be used and managed, for additonal details about it please visit the
